# MongoDB-Todo
This repository features a full-stack Todo app developed in stages. It started with a Node.js and MongoDB backend, followed by a frontend built using vanilla JavaScript. Later, the entire application was refactored and migrated to Next.js for a modern and efficient full-stack solution.
